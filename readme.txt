--Readme document for *Gabriel Zhang*, *gabriz2@uci.edu*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.

I didn't but if you "the cart." it is the name i have dubbed for the image that i have used as my background and meant to be a small side thing.

4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)

Understanding relative vs absolute path query to GEN AI and to confirm what the relative path for image is.

Used queries on the differences of CSS flexbox and Bootstrap and their primary purposes

Asked queries on how to accomplish CSS hover effect for effect (color) changes

Asked a query on helping me center the view works in CSS over my projects on hover effect. used some AI based code for the overlay in CSS file.

6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

Brandon Wong, discussing what tools can be used most efficiently with the layout im trying to build either by using bootstrap or CSS flexbox or both. Discuss the use of media queries and how they can be effective. Helped me diagnose accesibility issues.

I don't think so but please let me know if anything breaks. Just have all the images in the folder all downloaded.
